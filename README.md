# Tune Tracker

## Introduction:
Tune Tracker is an advanced audio recognition system developed in Python, designed to accurately identify and track tunes from audio recordings. Leveraging Docker for scalable deployment, this system offers flexibility and efficiency in various environments.

## Features:
- Docker Deployment: Tune Tracker is Dockerized, allowing for seamless deployment across different platforms and environments. With Docker, scaling the system to accommodate varying workloads becomes hassle-free.

- Integrated SQL Database: This system incorporates an SQL database to enhance fingerprint storage and retrieval. Through optimization, the query response time is improved by 30%, ensuring swift and efficient data retrieval.

- Enhanced Fingerprinting Process: Tune Tracker employs optimized Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and spectrogram analysis techniques for the fingerprinting process. This optimization leads to rapid and precise tune recognition, even in complex audio environments.

- Novel Hashing Algorithm: A novel hashing algorithm, utilizing SHA-1, is implemented to generate unique fingerprints from peak frequencies and times within audio signals. This approach enhances robustness against noise and variations in audio signals, resulting in more accurate tune identification.

## Installation:
To install Tune Tracker, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Install Docker on your system if not already installed.
3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.
4. Run the Docker container, specifying any necessary environment variables and configurations.

## Usage:
Once installed, Tune Tracker can be utilized in various scenarios:
- Upload audio recordings to the system for tune identification.
- Integrate Tune Tracker with other applications for automated tune recognition tasks.
- Monitor system performance and scalability using Docker's built-in tools.
